# JobGPT Prompts Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for integrating the comprehensive prompts.txt file with the JobGPT functionality in the OfferPlus application. The goal is to ensure that the JobGPT AI assistant can properly consume and utilize the structured prompts to provide high-quality, contextual responses for job seekers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Prompt Template System

**User Story:** As a JobGPT user, I want the AI to use appropriate prompt templates based on my selected mode, so that I receive contextually relevant and professionally structured responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select "Why Company" mode THEN the system SHALL use the Why Company system prompt and appropriate templates
2. WHEN I select "Behavioral" mode THEN the system SHALL use the Behavioral Interview system prompt and STAR method guidance
3. WHEN I select "General" mode THEN the system SHALL use the General Career system prompt and comprehensive career advice templates
4. WHEN I provide input text THEN the system SHALL combine the appropriate template with my input to create a complete prompt
5. WHEN the AI model is selected THEN the system SHALL optimize the prompt structure for that specific model (GPT vs DeepSeek)

### Requirement 2: Missing generatePrompt Method Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the jobgptService.generatePrompt method to exist and function properly, so that the JobGPT component can successfully make API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the JobGPT component calls jobgptService.generatePrompt(input, mode, model) THEN the method SHALL exist and execute without errors
2. WHEN generatePrompt is called THEN it SHALL select the appropriate prompt template based on the mode parameter
3. WHEN generatePrompt is called THEN it SHALL format the prompt with the user's input text
4. WHEN generatePrompt is called THEN it SHALL make the appropriate API call to the selected AI model
5. WHEN the API call succeeds THEN it SHALL return a properly formatted JobGPTResponse object
6. WHEN the API call fails THEN it SHALL throw an appropriate error with meaningful error messages

### Requirement 3: Prompt Template Loading and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the prompt templates to be efficiently loaded and managed, so that the application performs well and prompts can be easily updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load prompt templates from prompts.txt or a structured format
2. WHEN a prompt template is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve it efficiently without file I/O delays
3. WHEN prompt templates are updated THEN the system SHALL be able to reload them without application restart
4. WHEN template variables are used THEN the system SHALL properly substitute user input and context variables
5. WHEN invalid template references are made THEN the system SHALL fall back to default prompts gracefully

### Requirement 4: AI Model Integration

**User Story:** As a JobGPT user, I want to use different AI models (OpenAI GPT, DeepSeek) with optimized prompts, so that I get the best possible responses regardless of my model choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a GPT model THEN the system SHALL use OpenAI API with GPT-optimized prompts
2. WHEN I select a DeepSeek model THEN the system SHALL use DeepSeek API with DeepSeek-optimized prompts
3. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication and headers
4. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
5. WHEN different models are used THEN the response format SHALL be consistent across all models

### Requirement 5: Response Processing and Formatting

**User Story:** As a JobGPT user, I want AI responses to be properly formatted and displayed, so that I can easily read and use the generated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I receive an AI response THEN it SHALL be properly formatted with appropriate line breaks and structure
2. WHEN the response contains structured content THEN it SHALL maintain proper formatting (lists, sections, etc.)
3. WHEN the response is displayed THEN it SHALL show which model and mode were used
4. WHEN the response is too long THEN it SHALL be displayed in a readable format without truncation
5. WHEN the response contains special characters THEN they SHALL be properly escaped and displayed

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a JobGPT user, I want clear error messages and loading states, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator with the selected model name
2. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
4. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL validate and show helpful guidance
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL explain the limitation and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 7: Prompt Customization and Context

**User Story:** As a JobGPT user, I want the AI to consider additional context (like my resume, target role, company) when generating responses, so that the advice is more personalized and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide company name in Why Company mode THEN the prompt SHALL include company-specific research guidance
2. WHEN I provide role information THEN the prompt SHALL tailor advice to that specific role
3. WHEN I have uploaded a resume THEN the system SHALL consider resume context in responses
4. WHEN I provide additional context THEN the prompt SHALL incorporate relevant details
5. WHEN context is missing THEN the system SHALL prompt for additional information or use general templates

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want JobGPT to respond quickly and handle multiple concurrent requests, so that the application remains responsive under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users access JobGPT simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
2. WHEN prompt templates are accessed THEN they SHALL be cached for optimal performance
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (< 30 seconds)
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL maintain response quality and not degrade significantly
5. WHEN memory usage grows THEN the system SHALL manage resources efficiently without memory leaks

### Requirement 9: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the JobGPT prompt integration, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompt templates are loaded THEN unit tests SHALL verify correct template selection
2. WHEN generatePrompt is called THEN integration tests SHALL verify proper API integration
3. WHEN different modes are used THEN tests SHALL verify appropriate prompt formatting
4. WHEN error conditions occur THEN tests SHALL verify proper error handling
5. WHEN the system is deployed THEN end-to-end tests SHALL verify complete user workflows

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer or content manager, I want clear documentation on how to update and maintain JobGPT prompts, so that the system can be easily maintained and improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new prompt templates are added THEN documentation SHALL explain the process
2. WHEN prompt variables are used THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with examples
3. WHEN API integrations change THEN documentation SHALL be updated accordingly
4. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN logs SHALL provide sufficient information for debugging
5. WHEN the system is updated THEN version history SHALL track prompt template changes
